## Is it for you?
**Are you worried** on the existence of possible **nearby stars contaminating** your **TESS photometry**? Do you want to figure out **which sources** contaminate the most? and **how much of an impact** they have? Do you want to **correct SAP photometry for crowding** based on widely-used metrics such as CROWDSAP and FLFRCSAP? Do you want to **create custom photometric apertures** that **minimize contamination**? Do you want to **create paper-ready and eye-poping** plots (like the one below) that inform on the **crowding situation** of your favourites targets? For this and more, **tess-cont is your package!**
