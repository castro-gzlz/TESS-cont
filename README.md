Are you worried on the existence of possible nearby stars contaminating your TESS photometry? Do you want to figure out which sources contaminate the most? and how much of an impact they have? Do you want to correct SAP photometry for crowding based on widely-used metrics such as CROWDSAP and FLFRCSAP? Do you want to create custom photometric apertures that minimize contamination? Do you want to create paper-ready eye-poping plots that inform on the contamination situation of your favourites targets? For this and more, tess-cont is your package!
